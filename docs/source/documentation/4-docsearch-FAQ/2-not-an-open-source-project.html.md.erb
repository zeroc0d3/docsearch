## Our policy

We do really want to help documentation with search. Finding the information you are looking for is the very first step everyone go through when readung docs. Search is key.
You are not an open source project? Feel free to ask, open issue on our repo and even [run on your own our tool](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/documentation/docsearch-scraper/overview/). We will use our best effort in order to bootstrap you a nice search experience within your documentation.

``` javascript
Documentation.deserves(search)
```

## How could you qualify?

By focusing on open source project, we want to make our contribution to the open source community. We are learning every day thanks to this incredible way of learning, we want to help. We do ask a link to the project repo, e.g. gitlab, github or any term of use that outline this peculiarity.
